Project Name
OAuth Client-Server Example

Description
This endeavor offers a case study of how OAuth client-server communication can be realized using Python. It showcases the procedure of acquiring an access token from an OAuth server and utilizing it to ask for assets from a resource server. The code encompasses a pair of primary elements:

Client Code: The code on the client's side engages with the OAuth server to secure an access token, subsequently employing that token to requisition resources from the resource server.
OAuth Server Implementation: The code responsible for the OAuth server manages the authentication sequence, which encompasses client verification, creation of authorization codes, conversion of codes into access tokens, and validation of said tokens.
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- flask package
- requests package
Setup:
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/repository.git
Install the required packages:

pip install flask requests
Configuration
Prior to executing the code, it's necessary to set up the client ID and client secret within both the client and OAuth server code. Replace the temporary values (your_client_id and your_client_secret) with your real client credentials.

Instructions:
1. Launch the OAuth server by running:

```
python oauth_server.py
```

2. Initiate the resource server by running:

```
python resource_server.py
```

3. Execute the client code with the following command:

```
python client.py
```

Follow the prompts on the client console to authorize and initiate resource requests.
