The provided code demonstrates how to handle concurrent access to a shared resource using mutex locks in the C programming language. It ensures that multiple threads can increment a shared counter safely by acquiring and releasing a mutex lock around the critical section. Here's an overview of how it works:

The code defines the number of threads (NUM_THREADS) and the maximum count for the counter (MAX_COUNT).
A global variable counter is declared to represent the shared counter.
A mutex lock mutex is initialized to protect the counter from concurrent access.
Each thread executes the increment_counter function, responsible for incrementing the shared counter.
Inside increment_counter, a thread acquires the lock using pthread_mutex_lock to enter the critical section.
The thread increments the counter by one and releases the lock using pthread_mutex_unlock to exit the critical section.
This process is repeated MAX_COUNT times for each thread.
Once a thread finishes its task, it prints a message indicating its completion.
In the main function, threads are created using pthread_create, and pthread_join is used to wait for their completion.
After all threads have finished, the final value of the counter is printed.
The mutex lock is destroyed using pthread_mutex_destroy.
To execute the code, follow these steps:

Compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc -o concurrency concurrency.c -pthread
   ```

   Execute the program:

   ```bash
   ./concurrency
   ```
